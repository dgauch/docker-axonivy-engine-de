docker-axonivy-engine-de
========================

Create a docker image to run a Axon.ivy engine (deployment edition) (http://developer.axonivy.com). This special edition has already deployed the ivy deployement tool as a system application. So this edition is ready to be used for automatic deployments.

This docker image is based on the image `docker-axonivy-engine`. See there for detailed information about the usage.

Hints
-----

Use the following parameter to show the installed system applications on the Axon.ivy engine index page:
